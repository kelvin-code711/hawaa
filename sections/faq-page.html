                            <p>A HEPA (High-Efficiency Particulate Air) air purifier uses advanced filtration technology to remove 99.97% of particles as small as 0.3 microns from the air, including dust, pollen, pet dander, and other allergens.</p>
                            <p>Our HEPA filters go through rigorous testing to meet the highest industry standards. They're constructed with a dense web of fibers that create a maze for airborne particles to navigate. As air flows through the filter, particles are captured through a combination of interception, impaction, and diffusion.</p>
                            <p>Unlike standard filters, true HEPA filters must meet specific efficiency standards. We use medical-grade HEPA filters that are 50% more effective than standard HEPA filters, capturing particles as small as 0.1 microns with 99.99% efficiency.</p>

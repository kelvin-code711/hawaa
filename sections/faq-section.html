                <div class="faq__answer">
                    <p>A HEPA (High-Efficiency Particulate Air) air purifier is a device designed to remove airborne pollutants and allergens from your indoor environment. Our purifiers use true HEPA filtration that can capture 99.97% of particles as small as 0.3 microns, including dust, pollen, pet dander, and certain bacteria.</p>
                    <p>Through our advanced filtration system, clean air is circulated back into your space, helping you breathe easier and creating a healthier living environment.</p>

                    How often should I replace the filter?
                    <span class="faq__icon" aria-hidden="true"></span>

                <div class="faq__answer">
                    <p>We recommend replacing your air purifier filter every 6-8 months for optimal performance. However, filter life can vary depending on your air quality and usage patterns. Our smart indicator light will alert you when it's time for a replacement.</p>
                    <p>Homes with pets, high pollen counts, or in urban areas with pollution may need more frequent replacements. With our convenient auto-ship program, you can receive replacement filters right on schedule without having to remember to order.</p>

                    How quiet is your air purifier?
                    <span class="faq__icon" aria-hidden="true"></span>

                <div class="faq__answer">
                    <p>Our air purifiers are designed with sleep and comfort in mind. On the lowest setting, our units operate at just 24 decibels - quieter than a whisper. Even at the highest setting, the noise level remains below 50 decibels, which is comparable to gentle rainfall.</p>
                    <p>The sleep mode automatically dims the display lights and reduces fan speed during nighttime hours, ensuring your sleep remains undisturbed while still providing clean air throughout the night.</p>

                    Does your air purifier remove odors?
                    <span class="faq__icon" aria-hidden="true"></span>

                <div class="faq__answer">
                    <p>Yes, our air purifiers include a specialized activated carbon filter layer that effectively neutralizes household odors including cooking smells, pet odors, smoke, and VOCs (Volatile Organic Compounds) from cleaning products and new furniture.</p>
                    <p>Unlike some purifiers that simply mask odors, our carbon filtration technology actually absorbs and eliminates the molecular compounds causing unwanted smells, leaving your home truly fresh rather than artificially scented.</p>
